# ![cipy rules](./assets/cipy_rules_small.png) files-to-review app

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that comments on pull request
that certain files require review from predefined team and requests review from that team when certain file(s)
(e.g. LICENSE, etc.) is submitted with pull request [pr]. The latter action is performed only when team(s) is
configured. See the following diagram for details:

![legal-to-review flow](./assets/legal-to-review-flow.png?raw=true)

## Setup

### Default config

By default app works in `comment-on-pull-request` mode and matches pull request's files against the following
pattern:
```regexp
(licen(s|c)e)|(copyright)|(code.?of.?conduct)
```
as a result comment (similar to the one below) gets added to the pull request.

![legal-should-review comment](./assets/comment.png?raw=true)


### Configuration description

One can configure several review criterias in `./github/config.yml` according to the following structure:
```yaml
reviewCriteria:
  - configName:
    name: 'display-name'
    regexp: 'pattern-to-search-for'
    teams?:
      - 'optional-reviewers-team-name'

  ...
```
Note that `teams` parameter is optional and when it is provided given `review criteria` results in app issuing
2 actions `comment-on-pull-request` and `request-review-to-team` that manifests itself commenting which files
need to be reviewed and adding team(s) to reviewers list.

#### Example

Setting the following configuration in `.github/config.yml`
```yaml
reviewCriteria:
  - legal:
    name: 'legal-to-review'
    regexp: '(licen(s|c)e)|(copyright)|(code.?of.?conduct)'
    teams:
      - 'legal'
  - ui-experts:
    name: 'ui-experts-to-review'
    regexp: '\.css$'
```
results in the following actions being performed:
* comment indicating files to be reviewed by `legal-to-review` is added
* `legal` team is added to the _Reviewers_ list
* comment indicating files to be reviewed by `ui-experts-to-review` is added

It looks similar to the following pull request:

## TODO

Introduce the following feature(s):
* Add possibility to `request-review-to-team` based on PR author's team membership. This is especially handy when junior
  developer joins the org and his contributions should be reviewed by someone from mentors team.
* Consider acting on pull request updates.
